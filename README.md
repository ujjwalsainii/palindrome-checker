# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple Python script that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
   ```
   python palindrome_checker.py
   ```

2. Enter any string when prompted.  
   - If the string is a palindrome, it will print `Palindrome!`
   - Otherwise, it will print `Not a palindrome.`

3. Type `exit` to quit the program.

## What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam", "racecar", "121").
